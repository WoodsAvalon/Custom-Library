# Custom-Library
A simple library of objects and functions that I decided to build.

## Reasoning
While working on another project, I found that much of the code was going to be reused in future projects, so it was moved into this collection of files.
As such, this project will be added to as additional Math, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering and Financial functions are developed.

## What it looks like
